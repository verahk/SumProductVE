Description: This package contains an implementation of the factor-product and 
    Sum-Product-VE algorithm given in Koller (2009), for exact inference 
    in discrete Bayesian Networks. The factor-product procedure is implemented in Rcpp
    for speed and can be applied to factors (conditional probability tables, CPTs) 
    represented as multidimensional arrays (as in the bnlearn-package).
